# Android Developer Interview Task - Project Enhancements

1. **Android Version Compatibility**
   - The project lacked support for the latest Android version. I undertook the task of upgrading it, making necessary adjustments in the Gradle configuration. Additionally, I resolved the issue where the application was crashing on API levels above 29.

2. **Gradle Configuration Modification**
   - I made precise adjustments to the minimum and maximum Android version support parameters in the Gradle file, ensuring broader compatibility across various devices.

3. **Permission Refinement**
   - To bolster security and functionality, I incorporated the following permissions:
     1. Notification: `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
     2. Alarm: `android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM`
     3. Internet: `android.permission.INTERNET`
     4. Access Network State: `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`

4. **Best Practices Integration**
   - In adherence to industry best practices, I seamlessly integrated Hlit, Retrofit, Moshi, and co-routines into the project, enhancing its performance and maintainability.

5. **Helper Class Implementation**
   - I introduced essential helper classes to ensure secure API interactions, including Header Interceptor, Network Interceptor, SafeApiRequest, ApiException, and ApiRestService.

6. **Folder Structure Refinement**
   - Recognizing the absence of a structured folder arrangement, I meticulously organized the project to facilitate efficient code navigation and maintenance.

7. **Advanced Notification Handling (Above API Level S)**
   - In light of the lack of support for notifications above API level S, I devised a robust solution to ensure seamless functionality across all supported Android versions.

8. **Access Modifier Optimization**
   - Employing sound software engineering principles, I refined variable access modifiers, favoring private over public or friend scope wherever appropriate. This ensures enhanced encapsulation and maintainability.

9. **UI and Code Quality Enhancements**
   - I undertook a comprehensive review, striving to enhance both user interface and code quality. This included tasks such as:
     - Replacing hard-coded strings to achieve a more maintainable and easily translatable codebase.
     - Identifying and eliminating unused variables to expedite Gradle sync times.
     - Implementing UI improvements for a more polished and user-friendly experience.

10. **Time Investment**
    - It's worth noting that the scope of these enhancements required more than the initially estimated 2 hours. Achieving these improvements necessitated a meticulous and time-intensive approach.

These enhancements collectively contribute to a more robust, secure, and performant Android application. The changes made align with best practices in Android development, and the project is now well-equipped to handle the latest Android environments.
